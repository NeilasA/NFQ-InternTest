After opening program you can choose between Customer and specialist

After pressing Customer: You can choose to book and appointment or cancel an existing one.

Book an appointment: You can choose month day and time of you appointment and you text field for your name, after pressing
                     register you will be given appointment code that you need to use for canceling your appointment

Cancel an appointment: You need to put appointment code to text field and it will delete appointment corresponding to code

A Specialist: you come to specialist log in screen where you can log in or press register and go to register screen

Register: You have to type name password repeat password and access Code("test") or you will not be able to register
            after you register you data will be put to database.

Problem that I was not able to overcome is how taking data from sql server use it as variable So that I could check
if there is account with same name and password. So even you register you can't log in with account that you just made.
and I was not able to work with date and time so I was not able to make timer to see how much time has left till appointment.
